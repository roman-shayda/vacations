as we all know, Remit introduced its new vacation policy, according to which, after employee get's 26 days of vacation accrued, the count stops till the moment employee begins to use vacation.

At the moment you have accumulated 26 days of vacation or even more :) So we have to do something about  this. And here is the plan:
The transition period will last till March 1st, 2017. Till that time all of us have to manage our vacation plans. 
Use it for a refreshing time off. Fly to the sea this autumn, go skiing in winter, visit all your relatives for Christmas, so they will never complain again that forgot them. 
Take you sweet hurt to Paris or Bali for Valentines.
You now have an opportunity and you still have time for all of this.

Notice, that unused vacations over 26 vacation days will simply disappear from your disposal after 1st of March. So, do not hesitate ;)

When deciding on dates of your vacation, please talk to your manager.

Sincerely yours HR department
