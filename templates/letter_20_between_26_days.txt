as we all know, Remit introduced its new vacation policy, according to which, after employee get's 26 days of vacation accrued, the count stops till the moment employee begins to use vacation. 
Please, pay attention - you have gained over 20 vacation days. 
That means, you had little rest later and it's time to plan your vacation. 
In 3 month, when the amount of your vacation days will reach 26, accumulation will stop, until you will use some of them. 
Wish you to have a nice time off, full of adventures or peaceful joy, communication or blessing solitude with your favorite book in hand. Whatever it will be, have a time for yourself!

When deciding on dates of your vacation, please talk to your manager.

Sincerely yours HR department
